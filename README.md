# Investigation of Changes to Transcriptional Programs in Cystic Fibrosis-related Lung Disease Uncovers Differential Enrichment of Immunologic Gene Sets

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited condition resulting in damage to multiple organs due to an alteration in the function of secretory cells causing mucus to become obstructive in key pathways (1). Lung disease developing as a result of this disorder, known as bronchiectasis, is a  determining factor when it comes to patient condition and likelihood of death (1, 2). While past work has explored transcriptional differences related to cell state in the proximal airway of subjects affected by CF-related lung disease (2), little has been done to adequately investigate differences in gene expression programs related to immune response in CF tissues. Inquiring into these changes in the transcriptional profiles of cells in the human proximal airway, we performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset containing gene expression information for cells acquired from control (CO) samples, and samples acquired from patients affected by end-stage lung disease resulting from CF (3). GSEA of the scRNA-seq data from proximal airway samples, inputted with a collection of annotated human gene sets representing a variety of immune cell-states (3, 4), revealed the significant upregulation of substantially more gene sets associated with immune states in CO samples when compared to CF samples. Additionally, we find an increased degree of significance in the enrichment of gene sets upregulated in samples from CO airway tissues.
